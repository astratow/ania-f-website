# Ania's Website Project

## Downloads

Downloaded themes Laura and Portfolio.

Asked Ania for photos. She sent them via WhatsApp, 
so it took an hour to download them, rename and put in right places.

I changed pictures in hero and about sections.

About section content changed.

## 21.12.2021

Added new footer picture.

Removed testimonials and services sections.

Brought back social links, telephone number and email to contact section.

Added year to copyright (java script).

Uniformised navbar menu in Portfolio-details.html, so it directs back to index.html,
although considering creating new sites.

Categorised pictures and sorted them in folders, so I can create portofolios out of it.

Have an idea about creating portfolio detail card by changing dots into triangles which up, 
so it gives impression of progress:

That is for gallery. To be worked on.
